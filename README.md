# ChronoSphere 🕰️  

ChronoSphere is a JavaFX-based multi-clock system that blends analog, digital, and 3D elements into a visually captivating experience. 

## 🌟 Features

### Full-Screen Analog Clocks:
- Displays a central analog clock and multiple mini analog clocks arranged in concentric circles.
- Clocks update in real-time, showing the current hour, minute, and second.

### Dynamic Background:
- Background color changes smoothly every 5 seconds, transitioning between deep, muted colors.
- Adds a visually appealing effect to the application.

### Mini Clocks in Concentric Circles:
- Mini clocks are evenly spaced in three concentric circles around the central clock.
- Creates a visually interesting and symmetrical design.

### Customizable Clock Appearance:
- Central clock displays numbers (1–12) on its face, while the mini clocks do not.
- Clock hands (hour, minute, second) are colored differently for better visibility.

### Static Background Option:
- Includes an experimental circuit-like design for the background.
- Features light grayish (#a0a2ab) lines and connection points.

### Mathematical Expression Display:
- Displays a mathematical expression (e.g., -1 + 1/2) on the background.

### Responsive Design:
- Application is set to a fixed size (WIDTH = 845, HEIGHT = 795) and is not resizable.
- Ensures a consistent layout.

### Application Icon:
- Uses a custom icon (clock.png) for the stage.
